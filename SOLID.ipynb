    "### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, if class `S` is a subclass of class `T`, then objects of type `T` should be replaceable with objects of type `S` without affecting the behavior of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Ideas**\n",
    "1. Subtypes must adhere to the behavior expected of their base types.\n",
    "2. Derived classes should not:\n",
    "   - Weaken the preconditions of the base class.\n",
    "   - Strengthen the postconditions of the base class.\n",
    "   - Introduce unexpected behaviors or exceptions.\n",
    "3. A violation occurs when the subclass changes the functionality or introduces constraints that the base class does not impose.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Violating LSP**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how violating LSP can lead to unexpected behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",

    "        self.width = height\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "def calculate_area(rectangle):\n",
    "    rectangle.set_width(5)\n",
    "    rectangle.set_height(10)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Test with Square (Violation)\n",
    "calculate_area(Square(1, 1))  # Expected Area: 50, Actual Area: 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "- The `Square` class overrides `set_width` and `set_height` in a way that changes the behavior expected from the `Rectangle` class.\n",
    "- The function `calculate_area` assumes it is dealing with a `Rectangle`, but the `Square`'s behavior violates this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Correcting the Violation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To adhere to LSP, we need to avoid this type of unexpected behavior. A possible solution is to avoid using inheritance in this case and instead use composition.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Test with Square\n",
    "square = Square(5)\n",
    "calculate_area(square)  # Area: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- By using an abstract base class (`Shape`), we ensure that both `Rectangle` and `Square` adhere to the same interface (`get_area()`).\n",
    "- Each class encapsulates its unique behavior without violating the assumptions of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Guidelines to Follow LSP**\n",
    "1. Subclasses should **not override or weaken** the behavior of the base class methods.\n",
    "2. Ensure that derived classes honor all constraints of the base class.\n",
    "3. Use **composition over inheritance** when the \"is-a\" relationship is not clear.\n",
    "4. Write tests to verify that substituting a subclass does not alter the program's correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",

    "The decision to use a **stack** over other data structures depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved. A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This unique behavior makes stacks ideal for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Reasons to Use a Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LIFO Behavior**:\n",
    "   - A stack is perfect when the most recently added data needs to be processed or removed first.\n",
    "   - Example: Function call stacks in programming, where the last function called must finish execution before returning to the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Operations**:\n",
    "   - Stacks provide a simple interface with only two primary operations:\n",
    "     - **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "     - **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.\n",
    "   - This simplicity makes stacks easy to implement and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Management**:\n",
    "   - Stacks are used in memory allocation for managing function calls, recursion, and temporary storage during program execution.\n",
    "   - Example: The **call stack** in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - Stacks are ideal for problems that require backtracking or undo functionality.\n",
    "   - Example: Solving a maze, parsing expressions, or implementing an \"undo\" feature in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reversing or Tracking Order**:\n",
    "   - Stacks naturally reverse the order of elements due to their LIFO nature.\n",

    "   - Operations like push and pop are also \\( O(1) \\).\n",

    "   - Then, pop elements from `sorted_stack` and push them back to `input_stack` if they are greater than `current` (to make space for `current` in the correct position).\n",
    "   - After the loop, push `current` onto `sorted_stack`.\n",

    "   - By the end of the loop, all elements will be in `sorted_stack` in sorted order.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because for each element, we may need to pop all elements from the sorted stack and push them back into the input stack.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), as we use two stacks to store the elements.\n",

    "- **`__init__`**: This is the constructor that is called when an object is created.\n",

They are essential for creating reusable and flexible code structures. While both are used to achieve abstraction, they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Abstract Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must be subclassed by other classes. It can contain both **abstract methods** (methods without a body) and **concrete methods** (methods with an implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Cannot be instantiated**: You cannot create an object of an abstract class directly.\n",
    "- **Can have concrete methods**: An abstract class can have methods with an implementation (non-abstract methods).\n",
    "- **Can have abstract methods**: Abstract methods are methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses must provide an implementation for these methods.\n",
    "- **Can have member variables**: An abstract class can have instance variables, constructors, and other properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Python:\n",
    "\n",

    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",

    "\n",
    "An **interface** defines a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement. It doesn't provide any implementation itself; it only defines the method signatures. In Python, interfaces can be achieved using abstract base classes (ABCs), but they can also be simulated using just abstract methods in the class.\n",

    "### **Example Use Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're designing a system for a drawing application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: You might have an abstract class `Shape` that provides a common method for rendering (`render()`) and forces all specific shapes (like `Circle`, `Square`, etc.) to implement an `area()` method. \n",
    "- **Interface**: You might have an interface `Drawable` that enforces that all shapes should have a `draw()` method. Even though the `Shape` class already provides rendering, you might need an additional contract for drawing on different devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures that your code is both flexible and scalable, allowing different classes to implement specific behaviors while maintaining common functionality."

    "### **Design Patterns Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a standard way of solving particular design problems, making your code more reusable, flexible, and maintainable. Some common design patterns include **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, **Strategy**, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an in-depth explanation of **Singleton** and **Factory** design patterns with code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Singleton Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when you need to control access to shared resources (e.g., a database connection or a configuration manager).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Single instance**: Only one instance of the class is allowed.\n",
    "- **Global access**: The instance is globally accessible.\n",
    "- **Lazy initialization**: The instance is created only when it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example (Python)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Singleton:\n",
    "    _instance = None  # Class variable to store the single instance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __new__(cls):\n",
    "        # If instance is not created yet, create it\n",
    "        if cls._instance is None:\n",
    "            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)\n",
    "        return cls._instance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        if not hasattr(self, 'initialized'):  # To ensure initialization happens only once\n",
    "            print(\"Initializing Singleton instance.\")\n",
    "            self.initialized = True\n",
    "            self.value = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_value(self):\n",
    "        return self.value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "s1 = Singleton()\n",
    "s2 = Singleton()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(s1.get_value())  # Output: 42\n",
    "print(s1 is s2)        # Output: True (s1 and s2 refer to the same instance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `__new__` method ensures that only one instance of the `Singleton` class is created.\n",
    "- The `initialized` attribute prevents the `__init__` method from being called more than once.\n",
    "- Both `s1` and `s2` refer to the same instance, demonstrating the Singleton pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use**:\n",
    "- When you need to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.\n",
    "- When a class controls access to a resource, such as a database or a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Factory Pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It decouples the process of creating an object from the class that uses it, promoting flexibility in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Object creation abstraction**: Factory provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: The type of object created can be changed without modifying the code that uses it.\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: Object creation is separated from business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example (Python)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class AnimalFactory:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def create_animal(animal_type):\n",
    "        if animal_type == \"dog\":\n",
    "            return Dog()\n",
    "        elif animal_type == \"cat\":\n",
    "            return Cat()\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Unknown animal type\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "dog = AnimalFactory.create_animal(\"dog\")\n",
    "cat = AnimalFactory.create_animal(\"cat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation**:\n",
    "- **`AnimalFactory`** has a static method `create_animal()` that takes an `animal_type` argument and creates an object of the appropriate class (`Dog` or `Cat`).\n",
    "- The client code doesn’t need to know how the `Dog` or `Cat` objects are created; it just calls `AnimalFactory.create_animal()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use**:\n",
    "- When the creation process of objects is complex and you want to abstract that complexity.\n",
    "- When you need to create objects from a family of related classes based on user input or other conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Other Common Design Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observer Pattern**:\n",
    "   - The **Observer Pattern** is used when an object (called the \"subject\") maintains a list of its dependent observers and notifies them automatically of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Used in event handling systems (like GUI frameworks).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strategy Pattern**:\n",
    "   - The **Strategy Pattern** allows a class to choose an algorithm or behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Sorting algorithms or different ways of handling payment processing in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decorator Pattern**:\n",
    "   - The **Decorator Pattern** allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object without affecting its structure. It is often used to extend functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Adding new features to a window (e.g., scrolling, resizing, etc.) in a graphical user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adapter Pattern**:\n",
    "   - The **Adapter Pattern** allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper class that translates one interface to another.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Adapting an old API to work with a new system without modifying the old code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Command Pattern**:\n",
    "   - The **Command Pattern** encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Used in GUI systems where buttons are linked to specific commands.\n",

The **Singleton** and **Factory** patterns are two of the most widely used patterns, providing flexibility, abstraction, and reusability in your code. Each design pattern serves a different purpose, and choosing the right pattern can significantly improve the maintainability and scalability of your system."

    "### **Diamond Problem in Object-Oriented Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Diamond Problem** occurs in **multiple inheritance** scenarios, particularly when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. This can lead to ambiguity about which version of the common base class method should be used by the derived class. The issue arises because the derived class has multiple paths to the same base class, creating a \"diamond\" shape in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Diamond Problem Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified diagram of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        A\n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "      B   C\n",
    "       \\ /\n",
    "        D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram:\n",
    "- Class `A` is the base class.\n",
    "- Classes `B` and `C` inherit from class `A`.\n",
    "- Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If class `A` defines a method (e.g., `method()`), and both classes `B` and `C` override it, class `D` could end up with conflicting versions of the method. The ambiguity is: which version of the method should `D` use?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problems Created by the Diamond Problem**\n",
    "1. **Ambiguity in Method Resolution**: When a method is called on an object of the derived class (`D`), the language needs to decide which version of the method from `A` (or its subclasses) to call.\n",
    "2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Different parts of the inheritance tree might implement the method differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example in Python (without handling the Diamond Problem)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, if we use multiple inheritance without any resolution strategy, the problem might arise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from A!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from B!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from C!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(B, C):  # Inherits from both B and C\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of class D\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.greet()  # Which greet method should be called? B's or C's?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello from B!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Python uses the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to determine which method to call. The method `greet()` from class `B` is called because of the order in which classes are inherited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows the **C3 linearization algorithm** for method resolution, which ensures a consistent and predictable order of method lookup. In the case of multiple inheritance, it follows this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it checks `D`.\n",
    "- Then it checks `B`.\n",
    "- If no method is found, it checks `C`.\n",
    "- Finally, it checks `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Python Solves the Diamond Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**, which specifies the order in which base classes are searched when calling a method. Python’s MRO resolves the diamond problem by using the **C3 Linearization Algorithm**. It ensures that the method resolution order is consistent and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the MRO of a class by using the `mro()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(D.mro())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the order in which Python will look for the method in the class hierarchy, ensuring no ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Diamond Problem in Other Languages**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **C++**: C++ solves the diamond problem using **virtual inheritance**. When a class is virtually inherited, only one instance of the base class is shared by all derived classes, preventing the ambiguity. This avoids the problem of having multiple instances of the same base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class A {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    virtual void greet() {\n",
    "        cout << \"Hello from A!\" << endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class B : virtual public A {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void greet() override {\n",
    "        cout << \"Hello from B!\" << endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class C : virtual public A {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void greet() override {\n",
    "        cout << \"Hello from C!\" << endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class D : public B, public C {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    // Calls the correct greet method, using virtual inheritance\n",
    "    void greet() override {\n",
    "        cout << \"Hello from D!\" << endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `B` and `C` share the same instance of `A`, so the ambiguity is resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Java**: Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance for classes, so the diamond problem doesn't occur. However, multiple inheritance is possible through interfaces, and Java resolves this by ensuring that interfaces don’t cause method conflicts. If an interface has the same method in multiple inherited interfaces, the implementing class must override it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface A {\n",
    "    void greet();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface B extends A {\n",
    "    void greet();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface C extends A {\n",
    "    void greet();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class D implements B, C {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void greet() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello from D!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Diamond Problem** arises in multiple inheritance scenarios where a class inherits from two classes that share a common base class, leading to ambiguity about which version of the method should be used.\n",

    "### **Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node Class**: Represents a node in the linked list with a `value` and a `next` pointer.\n",
    "2. **has_cycle Function**: Implements the Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:\n",
    "   - Initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.\n",
    "   - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, and the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.\n",
    "   - If a cycle exists, the two pointers will eventually meet. If they meet, the function returns `True` indicating the presence of a cycle.\n",
    "   - If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` becomes `None`), it returns `False`, indicating no cycle.\n",
    "3. **create_linked_list Function**: A helper function to create a linked list from a list of values.\n",
    "4. **create_cycle Function**: A helper function to create a cycle in the linked list at a specified position (zero-indexed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**:\n",
    "- The list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is created, and a cycle is introduced at position `2` (node with value `3`).\n",
    "- The algorithm detects the cycle and prints \"Cycle detected in the linked list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
    "  - In the worst case, the fast pointer traverses the list once and the slow pointer may also traverse the list once.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "- The space complexity is **O(1)** since the algorithm uses only two pointers and does not require additional memory based on the size of the input."
