1. Given an array full of integers from 0 to 4 in random order how will you sort this array
2. Given a singly linked list find if the list is a palindrome, you only have to head no length is given and you have to solve in one loop and one pass, O(n)
3. Given a singly linked list and an integer n reverse the n size chunks and return the complete linked list. E.g. list 1->2->3->4->5->6 and n = 2 will return 2->1->4->3->6->5
